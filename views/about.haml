#about
  %p
    The idea behind MyCommuteCost.info 100% came from Brandon Morgado, 
    %a{:href => 'http://twitter.com/leadingzero'} 
      twitter.com/leadingzero
    \. My idea was to try to replicate his site, 
    %a{:href => "http://www.commutecost.com/"} commutecost.com
    , using Ruby, Sintra, HAML, and Sass. Plus, the domain only cost me $1.19 on godaddy.
  %p
    This site is open source, MIT licensed, and available on  
    %a{:href => 'http://github/chrisjones/commuteprice/tree/master'}  github
    \.

  Todo:
  %ul 
    %li Figure out the dumb whitespace munching on HAML %a tags - see above
    %li Figure out the Sass inheritance issues with the templates - defaulted to CSS for now
    %li Figure out HAML partials to shorten index.haml
    %li Add commas to costs if more than 3 digits
    %li Add last 10 prices in a javascript dropdown box below main content
    %li Screen scrape or store mpg for a year, make, model of car
    %li Screen scrape average gas for origin
